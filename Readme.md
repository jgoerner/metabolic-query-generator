<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

          <img src="images/about.png">
</p>

This repository **helps people** who like to intensify their **knowledge about the human metabolic pathways**.
The main idea is to encode a variety of those pathways in a graph database, which can be used to **automatically generate questions** which might be used for **exam preparation**.

DISCLAIMER: As I did not study anything biology related, I can't ensure that all information is encoded correctly.
Therefore I highly encourage all attentive readers to [open an issue](https://github.com/jgoerner/query-generator/issues) whenever information shall be adjusted, in order to keep the knowledge as correct as possible.

🧬🧪Metabolic Pathways:
- [ ] Glycolysis
- [ ] Pentose Phosphate Pathway
- [ ] Gluconeogenesis
- [ ] Cori Cycle
- [ ] ...

🤖❓Generated Question Types:

- [ ] What does the abbreviation "FBP" stand for?
- [ ] What is the abbreviation for Fructose bisphosphate?
- [ ] Which enzymes are part of the glycolysis?
- [ ] Which enzyme is responsible for the transormation from glucose to glucose-6-phosphate?
- [ ] What is the process to transform glucose into fructose 1,6 biphosphate?
- [ ] Which metabolic pathways consume nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide?
- [ ] Which metabolic pathways create adenosine triphosphate?
- [ ] What type of molecule is sucrose?
- [ ] What reactions of the glycolysis are reversible?
- [ ] What is the purpose of the Cori cycle?
- [ ] ...

Further pathways and/or question types can be added by [raising an issue](https://github.com/jgoerner/query-generator/issues).
